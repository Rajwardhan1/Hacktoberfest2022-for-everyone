Probelem Statement
Chef has a binary string S of length N.
In one operation, Chef can:

Select two indices i and j (1≤i,j≤N,i≠j) and flip Si and Sj. (i.e. change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0)
For example, if S=10010 and chef applys operation on i=1 and j=3 then: 1–00–10→00110.

Find if it is possible to convert S to a palindrome by applying the above operation any (possibly zero) number of times.
Note: A string is called a palindrome if it reads the same backwards and forwards, for e.g. 10001 and 0110 are palindromic strings.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N — the length of the binary string S.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string S of length N containing 0s and 1s only.

Output Format
For each test case, output YES if it is possible to convert S to a palindrome. Otherwise, output NO.
You can print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings YES, yes, Yes, and yEs are all considered the same.

Constraints
1≤T≤10^5
1≤N≤10^5
S contains 0 and 1 only.
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

Solution
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    int n;
	    cin>>n;
	    string s;
	    cin>>s;
	    int c=0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
 
        if (s[i] != s[n - i - 1]) {
            c++;
        }
    }
    if(n%2==0 && c%2!=0)
    cout<<"No"<<endl;
    else
    cout<<"Yes"<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
